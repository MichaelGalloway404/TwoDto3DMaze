# 2D to 3D maze 
This was originally a project I worked on for CS 361 Software Engineering I writtin Python and Pygame.  
I rewrote it in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
The player walks around a 2D maze of 1's and 0's, 1=wall and 0=floor.  
If a wall is detected an image of the corresponding wall is overlaid onto the main background image creating the illusion of 3D.  

Player and uses buttons on screen or keyboard. Maze coming soon.
