# 2D to 3D maze 
This was originally a project I worked on for CS 361 Software Engineering I writtin Python and Pygame.  
I rewrote it in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
The player walks around a 2D maze of 1's and 0's, 1=wall and 0=floor.  
If a wall is detected an image of the corresponding wall is overlaid onto the main background image creating the illusion of 3D.
